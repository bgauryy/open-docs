> Deep-dive documentation for AI CLI tools ‚Äî the stuff official docs don't cover.

**For developers, researchers, and power users** who need to understand how these tools actually work under the hood. We extract undocumented features, hidden APIs, architecture internals, gotchas, and real implementation patterns directly from source code.

**Why use these docs?** Official docs tell you *what* to do. We show you *how it works*, *what's not documented*, and *what breaks*.

*All content extracted from public open-source repositories ‚Äî no proprietary info, no secrets, just better organized knowledge.*

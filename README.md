# open-docs

> Creating comprehensive, high-quality documentation for complex technical projects that deserve better docs.

## What is this?

**open-docs** is a documentation initiative focused on producing thorough, well-structured technical documentation for open-source projects. Many powerful tools and frameworks have incomplete, scattered, or hard-to-navigate documentation. This project aims to fix that.

By combining automated research, code analysis, and systematic organization, we create comprehensive documentation that covers:

- **Undocumented features** - Capabilities that exist in the code but aren't officially documented
- **Architecture deep-dives** - Internal structure, design patterns, and implementation details
- **Complete API references** - Every tool, function, and interface with practical examples
- **Gotchas and edge cases** - Hidden issues, quirks, and important implementation notes
- **Real-world usage** - Practical guides based on actual code patterns and best practices

### Principles

- **Open Source Only** - All documentation is derived exclusively from publicly available open-source repositories and community resources
- **No Proprietary Content** - We never include private, confidential, or proprietary materials
- **Automated + Human-Curated** - Leveraging AI-powered research with human oversight for quality and accuracy
- **Community-Driven** - Built from and for the community

## üìö Available Documentation

### [Claude Code](docs/claude-code/README.md)
Complete documentation for the claude-code CLI tool, including all prompts, internal tools, architecture, and undocumented features.

### [Claude Agent SDK](docs/claude-agent-sdk/README.md)
Comprehensive guide to the claude-agent-sdk, covering agents, tools, hooks, permissions, types, and implementation patterns.

### [Codex CLI](docs/codex_cli/README.md)
Full documentation of the codex_cli project, including prompt processing, LLM integration, tool system, security, and MCP integration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each documentation set includes:
- A comprehensive README with navigation guide
- Multiple focused documents covering specific aspects
- Code examples and practical usage patterns
- Architecture diagrams and implementation details

Start by browsing the README for any documentation set above, or use the search functionality to find specific topics.

## üîç Recommended Tools

For intelligent exploration of this repository, we recommend using **Octocode MCP** - a smart AI code and GitHub research MCP server that creates better context for you and your AI agents.

### Why Octocode MCP?

**Octocode MCP** enhances your development environment by providing AI agents with powerful code research capabilities:

- **Smart Code Search** - Advanced pattern matching and semantic search across codebases
- **Structure Analysis** - Understand directory layouts, dependencies, and file organization
- **Content Exploration** - Efficient file reading with pagination and context extraction
- **Intelligent Navigation** - Quick discovery of relevant documentation and implementations
- **Cross-Reference Analysis** - Connect related concepts across multiple documentation sets (and actual repositories)

### Perfect for This Repository

When working with open-docs, Octocode MCP helps you:
- Quickly find specific topics across Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, and Codex CLI docs
- Understand relationships between different projects and their implementations
- Search for patterns, APIs, and features across all documentation
- Navigate complex documentation structures efficiently
- Build comprehensive context for AI-assisted development

### Get Started

- **Repository:** [github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp](https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp)

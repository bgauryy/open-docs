# open-docs

> Creating comprehensive, high-quality documentation for complex technical projects that deserve better docs.

## What is this?

**open-docs** is a documentation initiative focused on producing thorough, well-structured technical documentation for open-source projects. Many powerful tools and frameworks have incomplete, scattered, or hard-to-navigate documentation. This project aims to fix that.

By combining automated research, code analysis, and systematic organization, we create comprehensive documentation that covers:

- **Undocumented features** - Capabilities that exist in the code but aren't officially documented
- **Architecture deep-dives** - Internal structure, design patterns, and implementation details
- **Complete API references** - Every tool, function, and interface with practical examples
- **Gotchas and edge cases** - Hidden issues, quirks, and important implementation notes
- **Real-world usage** - Practical guides based on actual code patterns and best practices

### Principles

- **Open Source Only** - All documentation is derived exclusively from publicly available open-source repositories and community resources
- **No Proprietary Content** - We never include private, confidential, or proprietary materials
- **Automated + Human-Curated** - Leveraging AI-powered research with human oversight for quality and accuracy
- **Community-Driven** - Built from and for the community

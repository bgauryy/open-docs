> Deep-dive documentation for AI CLI tools ‚Äî the stuff official docs don't cover.

**For developers, researchers, and power users** who need to understand how these tools actually work under the hood. We extract undocumented features, hidden APIs, architecture internals, gotchas, and real implementation patterns directly from source code.

**Why use these docs?** Official docs tell you *what* to do. We show you *how it works*, *what's not documented*, and *what breaks*.

*All content extracted from public open-source repositories ‚Äî no proprietary info, no secrets, just better organized knowledge.*

## üí° Motivation

Open source doesn't automatically mean well-documented. While these projects are publicly available, critical details often remain buried in implementation code:

- **Undocumented features** ‚Äî Experimental APIs, beta functionality, and hidden capabilities not in official docs
- **Implementation internals** ‚Äî How things actually work vs. what the public API exposes
- **System prompts** ‚Äî The actual instructions sent to LLMs that shape agent behavior
- **Real-world patterns** ‚Äî Gotchas, edge cases, and integration nuances learned from source code

This repository started when I tried to understand **how the Task tool works under the hood** across different CLI agents. That single question led to extracting architecture diagrams, security models, tool systems, and undocumented flows that weren't explained anywhere else.

**For developers and agents:** Use this as a reference when building AI workflows, understanding tool implementations, or debugging complex behaviors. These docs bridge the gap between "read the source" and "trust the marketing page."
